# PawsitionPatrol

PawsitionPatrol is a cool program that lets you track and monitor the movement of a single animal over time, perfect for lab studies where the animal you're interested in is the only thing moving in the video. It's a handy tool for researchers to observe and analyze animal behavior in controlled environments.

## Features

- Video analysis: The program analyzes video footage to detect and record the position of animals in each frame.
- Zone definition: Users can define specific zones within the video where the animal's movement is of interest.
- Interactive playback: PawsitionPatrol offers a user-friendly interface to display video playback, with real-time visualization of animal positions and zone labels.
- Data recording: The program records the animal's position, associated time, and the zone it belongs to in a CSV file for further analysis.
- Zone statistics: PawsitionPatrol calculates the time spent by the animal in each defined zone, providing insights into zone preferences.
- Plot visualization: The program generates a plot that visualizes the recorded animal positions over time.
- Animal agnostic: PawsitionPatrol can be used to track the movement of various animals, making it flexible for different research or monitoring applications.
